# AutoBase64
## Automatic Base64 encoder and decoder
With this you can autmaticly encode and decode multiple levels of Base64 (eg. Original text -> encoded layer 1 -> encoded layer 2..)

!! You need to reload the log manually with the button to see new log (because I'm stupid) !!

### Known Bugs:
1. If you have too much text in the log it starts lagging
2. Sometimes the decoded text hasn't been fully decoded (a) or is too much decoded (b). If that happens:
  a) just try pasting the output code in the decompiling form and decompile one more time.
  b) paste the output in the encoding form and encode it 1 time
